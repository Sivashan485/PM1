## Running in Other IDEs

If you choose to run the text-editor in a different IDE, please be aware of the potential graphical issues mentioned earlier. While we strive to provide a seamless experience, we cannot guarantee the same level of performance and graphical fidelity as when using IntelliJ IDEA.

We appreciate your understanding and will do our best to assist you with any problems you may encounter while editing text in different IDEs.
